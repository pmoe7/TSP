# TSP
Implementation of the Travelling Salesman Problem problem in C++
We have implemented the greedy algorithm, to find shortest possible route between all capital cities of our provinces and territories. This was done for a grade 11 CS class. The code structure or implementation may not be the best or most efficent since this was our first time ever, coding in c++.
