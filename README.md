# TSP
Implementation of the Travelling Salesman Problem problem in C++
We have implemented the greedy algorithm, to find shortest possible route between all capital cities of our provinces and territories.
This was done for a grade 11 CS class. The code structure or implementation may not be the best or most efficent since this was our 
first time ever, coding in c++. 


##Inpute Data Format:
Whitehorse - city name (max 10 chars)
3 - x coordinate (x ∈ I, 0 < i < 70)
4 - y cordinate (y ∈ I, 0 < i < 33)
